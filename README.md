In this assignment, I collected hardware and software information on a EC2 machine and wrote some scripts to perform simple data analysis tasks.

To test the `count_python.sh`:

1. Clone and change directory into the repository
2. Download and save the `stackoverflow.zip` in `_output/`
3. Change directory into `_output/`
4. Run `unzip stackoverflow.zip` to extract the dataset into `_output/`
5. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x count_python.sh`
6. Finally, run the script by `./count_python.sh`

To test the `count_github.py`:

1. Clone and change directory into the repository
2. Download and save the `stackoverflow.zip` in `_output/`
3. Change directory into `_output/`
4. Run `unzip stackoverflow.zip` to extract the dataset into `_output/`
5. Finally, run the script by `python3 count_github.py`
